NEXUM - Log off. Show up.

Privacy‑first platform to discover real‑world events in your city — supported by AI, designed fpr safe group experiences. 

WHAT IS NEXUM? 
Nexum is a community‑driven event discovery platform that helps people:
- find local events
- explore interest‑based meetups
- feel at home in a new city

Unlike traditional social platforms, Nexum is privacy‑first by design and focuses on real‑world group interaction instead of private online communication.
There are: No direct 1:1 chats, no dating mechanics an no external WhatsApp group linking
Users connect through shared experiences — not private messaging.
There are: Event‑based interaction only
There are: Safe, moderated group environments

AI‑ASSISTANT - Nexum integrates AI to improve:
- event discovery
- user onboarding
- in‑app support
- community feedback analysis

Examples:
Users can ask: "How was the last event?"
And receive an AI‑generated summary such as: "According to participants, the event was very fun and well‑organised."

The AI does not invent responses. It analyses:
- user ratings
- written feedback
- attendance data
…and generates aggregated summaries based on real participant experiences.

This allows:
- better event transparency
- informed participation decisions
- trust‑based recommendations
